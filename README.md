# Polyglot
🚀 **Polyglot: A Source-to-Source Compiler**  A transpiler (e.g., Python 🐍 -> JS 📜) built on a full AST parse-transform-generate pipeline. This isn't just string replacement; it's a deep semantic translation.  The goal? To be the foundational "language service" for **Synapse** 🧠, my project for an AI-native, polyglot IDE.
